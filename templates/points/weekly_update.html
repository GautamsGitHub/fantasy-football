<h1>
    Weekly Update
</h1>
<p>
    Add a game week that will have all of the
    matches that have been played but are not
    in a game week yet.
</p>
<p>
    Accidentally doing this is not too problematic.
    If you want to get rid of the accidental gameweek,
    go to the admin page and delete it; the games and
    events will stick around, but the points and the
    fantasy squad weeks won't.
